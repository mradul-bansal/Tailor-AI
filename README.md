# 🎯 AI-Driven Tailoring Measurement System

This project is a smart measurement system designed for tailoring services, where customers can enter their body measurements manually or submit images for AI-based measurement predictions. It streamlines the tailoring workflow and reduces human error, helping tailors provide accurate fits for their clients.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 **AI-Based Image Measurement**: Predicts body dimensions from uploaded images using ML models.
- 🧵 **Manual Input Form**: Customers can manually input their measurements.
- 👨‍🏫 **Tailor Dashboard**: Tailors can view, manage, and act on incoming measurement data.
- 🔐 **Authentication**: Separate logins for customers and tailors.
- 📦 **MongoDB Integration**: Stores and fetches all customer and measurement data.
- 🌐 **React Frontend**: Smooth and responsive user interface.

## 🛠 Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local system:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
````

### 2. Install Git LFS (for large file support)

> Some parts of the project are large and are hosted separately using Git Large File Storage (LFS).

```bash
# Install Git LFS
https://git-lfs.com/

# Once installed
git lfs install
```

### 3. Download Remaining Files from Google Drive

Due to GitHub's size limitations, the complete project files (e.g., model weights, AI scripts, large assets) are stored in Google Drive.

🔗 **Download the full project files here**: [Google Drive Link]([https://drive.google.com/your-download-link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VkXjLzHTr7LRP3S5m4pXIR-dcHl4vxjT?usp=drive_link))

After downloading:

* Extract the folder
* Copy and paste the missing files/folders (e.g., `/models`, `/uploads`, `/ai-scripts`, etc.) into your cloned repo

### 4. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 5. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 6. Create Environment Files

Make sure to add a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

You can customize ports and other variables as needed.
